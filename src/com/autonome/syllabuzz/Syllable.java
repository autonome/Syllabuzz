/**
 * <p>
 * Routine for estimating syllable count in words.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This is a straight port of perl's Lingua::EN::Syllable written by Greg Fast
 * (comments and all).
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Note that it isn't entirely accurate... it fails (by one syllable) for about
 * 10-15% of my /usr/dict/words. The only way to get a 100% accurate count is to
 * do a dictionary lookup, so this is a small and fast alternative where
 * more-or-less accurate results will suffice, such as estimating the reading
 * level of a document.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * I welcome pointers to more accurate algorithms, since this one is pretty
 * quick-and-dirty. This was designed for English (well, American at least)
 * words, but sometimes guesses well for other languages.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>Known Limitations</b>
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Accuracy for words with non-alpha characters is somewhat undefined. In
 * general, punctuation characters, et al, should be trimmed off before handing
 * the word to syllable(), and hyphenated compounds should be broken into their
 * separate parts.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Syllables for all-digit words (eg, "1998"; some call them "numbers") are
 * often counted as the number of digits. A cooler solution would be converting
 * "1998" to "nineteen eighty eight" (or "one thousand nine hundred eighty
 * eight", or...), but that is left as an exercise for the reader.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Contractions are not well supported.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Compound words (like "lifeboat"), where the first word ends in a silent 'e'
 * are counted with an extra syllable.
 * </p>
